<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an entry-level web developer with a strong passion for building clean, responsive, 
and user-friendly websites. I recently completed my training in web development, 
where I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps. 
I enjoy solving problems through code and bringing ideas to life in the browser.

<p>While I'm at the beginning of my professional journey,
I'm a fast learner, highly motivated, and always eager to grow. I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute
to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and continue building my skills in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>I'm excited to be part of the tech world and look forward to creating impactful digital experiences.</p>
